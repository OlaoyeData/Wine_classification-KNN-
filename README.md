# Wine_classification(KNN)
 A project that applies the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify the Wine dataset.

# Introduction
This project demonstrates the use of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify the Wine dataset. The Wine dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning, consisting of 178 samples of wine, each described by 13 features such as alcohol content, malic acid, ash, and more.

# Features
Classification of wine samples using KNN,
Evaluation of model performance,
Visualization of results
